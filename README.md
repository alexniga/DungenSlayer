# DungenSlayer

Game Overview: Dungeon Clear

In this game, you play as a character who enters a temple or similar setting, armed with a basic ranged weapon. Each room you enter (effectively a new level) requires you to either eliminate all surrounding enemies or solve puzzles to advance. Enemies have a chance to drop artifacts or new weapons, which grant bonus stats to facilitate a quicker and easier dungeon clear. These items also aid in progressing through increasingly challenging levels.

Upon clearing a room, you will be presented with one or more doors leading to the next room. The current planned door types include:

Boss Fight
Shop
Puzzle Room (failure to solve the puzzle in time results in a mini-boss fight)
Normal Room
The objective of the game is to defeat the ultimate boss to find a way out of the dungeon.
